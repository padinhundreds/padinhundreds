Hello!

I'm glad you made it here. This website has grown since inception as a capstone project completed for YAMD (Yet Another Master's Degree). The joke here is that I coded this website using quatro.yml, where yml = YAML and stands for "Yet Another Markup Language."

Anyway, two interests I am passionate to the point of writing about are:

1.  Soccer

    -   Player/Team Analysis
    -   Transfer Analysis

2.  Economics

    -   Strategy & Decision Making
    -   My Portfolio

Ever since Prof. Chuck Lindsey from UB said to incorporate a specialization to my soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been a passion. See how I combine technical skill with inherent passion to ascend socioeconomic barriers.

Be sure to check out my posts!
