*Subject: Who is Steven M. Padin?*

Hello!

This website has grown since inception as a capstone project completed for YAMD (Yet Another Master's Degree). The joke here is that I coded this website using quatro.yml, where yml = YAML and stands for "Yet Another Markup Language."

Anyway, two interests I am passionate to the point of writing about are:

1.  Soccer
    -   Player/Team statistics

    -   Transfer analysis
2.  Economics
    -   My Portfolio & impacting headwind/tailwinds

Ever since Prof. Chuck Lindsey from UB said to incorporate a specialization to my soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been a passion. See how I combine these technical skill with my inherent passion to ascend socioeconomic barriers.
