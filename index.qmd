Hello all, this is a project I completed for my second Master's degree. I enjoy soccer, machine learning / artificial intelligence, economics and food.

Ever since Chuck Lindsey from University at Buffalo told me I should incorporate a specialization to my burgeoning soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been my passion.

I hope you enjoyed reading this insight to my journey - please use my contact information in the top right-hand corner!
