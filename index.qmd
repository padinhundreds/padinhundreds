Hello all, this website has grown since the project I completed for YAMD (Yet Another Master's Degree) - the joke here is that I coded this website using quatro.yml, where yml = YAML and stands for "Yet Another Markup language."

Anyway, I enjoy three things I am passionate to the point of writing about them are;

1.  Soccer
2.  technology,
3.  economics and food. This Blog will consist mainly of the first three.

Ever since Chuck Lindsey from University at Buffalo told me I should incorporate a specialization to my burgeoning soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been my passion.

I hope you enjoyed reading this insight to my journey - please use my contact information in the top right-hand corner!
