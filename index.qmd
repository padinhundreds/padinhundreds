*Subject: Who is Steven M. Padin?*

Hello All,

This website has grown since inception as a capstone project completed for YAMD (Yet Another Master's Degree) - the joke here is that I coded this website using quatro.yml, where yml = YAML and stands for "Yet Another Markup Language."

Anyway, three interests I am passionate to the point of writing are:

1.  Soccer - player/team statistics & transfer analysis
2.  Technology - development of machine learning & adjacent sectors
3.  Economics - quantitative analysis and news

This Blog will consist of these topics to varying degrees

Ever since Dr. Chuck Lindsey from UB told me to incorporate a specialization to my soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been my passion.

I hope you enjoyed reading this insight to my journey - please use my contact information in the top right-hand corner!
