A Pecha Kucha is a presentation template that displays 20 pictures for 20 seconds each, resulting in a 6 minute and 40 second video. This Pecha Kucha I created was on Nvidia back in October 2023, when their stock price (pre-split) was around \$400 - now the price in pre-split terms is about \$1,300. Below is an outline of what I speak about in the above video.
