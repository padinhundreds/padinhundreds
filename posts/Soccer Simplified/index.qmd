With the European Championship (Euros) in full swing, it is a great time to learn the basics of soccer to impress that guy, lady, family member, or local bar patron always going on about how their team is going to do something this year. The sport is played by 265 million people worldwide, nearly the entire population of the United States. Chances are, if you know anyone that is foreign, they, or their father are fans of a certain club. Let's get to the fundamental basics.

Basics:

-   11 players on each team (10 Field + 1 Goalie)

    -   Each player needs to be proficient shooting, passing, defending,

-   The field dimension vary slightly but the average is 115 yards long by 75 yards wide

    -   The goal is 8 yards wide by 8 feet high

-   The only player that can use their hands during play is the Goalie

    -   Throw-ins (ball goes out of bounds on the sideline) are the only exception

-   A Goal kick means an opposition player kicked the ball out of bounds towards the 75 yard goal line

-   Game duration is 90 minutes split into two 45-minute halves,

    -   "Stoppage/extra time" builds for injuries, streakers, and general nonsense - it is between 3 and 7 minutes

    -   Depending on the tournament/competition, ties are settled as ties or go into Penalties

        -   Penalties are best of five, if tied - one for one until someone misses

Did You Know;

Players run 7-10 miles per game; midfielders run the most.

Top speeds of players regularly range from 16-22 mph, Usain Bolt's world-record sprint averaged slightly over 23 mph

Finally, here are 3 overall tactics that a team will execute. When the lineup is read, it goes from back to front, starting with the defenders. The lineup gives a visual represntation of how the 10 field players will line up.

4-4-2 is common, rudimentary, but practical

4-2-3-1 is a bit more modern and allows a bit more specialization of player

3-5-2-1 is futuristic as it converts defenders into attacking players and requires unique players.
