*Subject: Who is Steven M. Padin?*

Hello all,

This website has grown since inception as just a capstone project completed for YAMD (Yet Another Master's Degree) - the joke here is that I coded this website using quatro.yml, where yml = YAML and stands for "Yet Another Markup Language."

Anyway, three interests I am passionate to the point of writing are;

1.  Soccer
2.  Technology
3.  Economics

This Blog will consist mainly of the first three.

Ever since Professor Chuck Lindsey, PhD from UBuff told me I should incorporate a specialization to my soft skills, learning how to interact with data in a meaningful way has been my passion.

I hope you enjoyed reading this insight to my journey - please use my contact information in the top right-hand corner!
