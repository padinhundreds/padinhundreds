Some interesting facts about me are;

2.  Both sets of my grandparents are from the Caribbean.

3.  I have lived in 5 States in the United States.

4.  I am an only child.

These are some of my Role Models:

FOIA Man, Ronaldinho, David (David & Goliath), Roaring Kitty, Son Goku, Jensen Huang, Steven P. Jobs

Here are some books I enjoyed reading:

The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed or Fail by Ray Dallio, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Harry Potter Series,

And this is some of the media I consume in my free time: All-in Podcast, Kurzgesagtz, Brilliant, Ground News

If any of these experiences, people, or media had you curious, feel free to email me, drop a message on my GitHub account, or follow me on IG where I will rant/rave about any of the above & more!
